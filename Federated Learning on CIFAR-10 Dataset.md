Federated Learning on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project implements a federated learning algorithm on the CIFAR-10 dataset to solve a multiclass classification problem. The algorithm utilizes a client-server model with 20 clients and a central server. The clients are trained on a VGG-19 model architecture.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Federated Learning Process
In this project, we have adopted a federated learning approach to train a model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Federated learning allows training a model on distributed data without the need to centralize the data on a single server. Instead, the data remains on individual clients, and the model is trained locally on each client.

Client-Server Model: The federated learning algorithm follows a client-server architecture. The central server coordinates the training process while the clients perform local training on their respective datasets.

VGG-19 Model: The VGG-19 model is utilized as the base model for training. VGG-19 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its excellent performance on image classification tasks.

Random Selection of Clients: Out of the 20 clients, six clients are randomly selected for each training iteration. This random selection ensures that a diverse set of clients contribute to the training process.

Training and Averaging: The selected clients train their models locally using their respective datasets. Once training is complete, the models are averaged to obtain a global model. This process helps to aggregate the knowledge learned by different clients.

Epochs: The training process continues for 20 epochs, where each epoch represents a complete pass through the dataset. The central server coordinates the training and averaging process for each epoch.

Results
After training the federated learning model for 20 epochs, using the centralized model and ensuring data integrity and privacy, we achieved an accuracy of 78 percent. The model's performance was evaluated on a separate test set.

The training process took approximately 20 minutes to complete. The execution time may vary depending on the computational resources available.

Please note that the accuracy and training time mentioned here are specific to this implementation and may vary under different conditions, such as hardware, dataset size, and model complexity.

Usage
To run this federated learning implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, follow these steps:

Set up the environment: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

Download the CIFAR-10 dataset: Obtain the CIFAR-10 dataset and preprocess it according to your requirements.

Configure the client-server model: Adjust the parameters of the federated learning algorithm, such as the number of clients, client selection strategy, model architecture, and training epochs, to suit your needs.

Train the federated learning model: Run the training process on your chosen hardware or computing resources. Monitor the progress and observe the convergence of the model.

Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test set to measure its accuracy and generalization ability.

Remember to handle data privacy and integrity appropriately when implementing federated learning in real-world scenarios.
